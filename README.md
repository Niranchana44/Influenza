I am very interested in the application of data science and artificial intelligence to transform healthcare.Covid-19 caused a massive upheavel in the society and affected numerous people.There are other respiratory illnesses that affect significant proportion of population around the world.Influenza is a common illness that cause mild to severe symptoms and could also be deadly. I feel better understanding and tracking incidence of the illness can help in better managing them.
I chose this data because it is very comprehensive,covers data pertaining to incidence of influenza across counties on a weekly and yearly basis, provides classification according to influenza type A or B or mention of other category of respiratory illness when tested for influenza. Data in the other data file can also help in estimating the seriousness of the incident lung infections .I believe this can facilitate in depth anaylsis to yield several informative insights.It can help to better understand the disease spread,identify trends,determine the contagious type of virus and fatality of respiratory illness across the age groups etc.
This type information can help public health organizations track the disease,understand trends in virus and impact and take effective action to control the spread. It can help in administering vaccines,develop more effective flu shots, forecast future spread and take preventive measures.It can also help healthcare providers in better decision-making.
